Hopper keyboard

This is a splayed ortolinear keyboard I created based from the need to have an extra pinkey row for the Swedish ä and å. 
It reminds of the Corne but has a splayed layout and a more agressive stagger.

## Features
- Ortolinear
- Splay key layout
- RGB led per key
- Batery and on/off switch for wireless setup
- Oled
- The inner tumb can be replaced by a rotary switch
